title: 'How Do I Adopt?'

#### What is involved in adopting microservices?

##### There are 2 things to think about:

1. Software architecture: can I adopt microservices incrementally or do i need to go wholesale?
  * You can experiment/test incrementally.
2. Changes to your stack (and do you need to make them wholesale)
  * deploy using your existing stack

#### Do I have to adopt microservices wholesale?

An important consideration in the question of adopting microservices is that a microservices architecture is not an all-or-nothing proposition. Organizations can (and should) add microservices a few at a time, as business requirements and organizational needs dictate.
